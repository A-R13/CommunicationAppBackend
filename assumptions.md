
dataStore
- Data is stored as an object containing an array of users and channels. 
- 

ClearV1
- After running the function the 'cleared' data is just an empty array of users and channels
- If the data structure differs to the one assumed in dataStore, the clear function should reset it to an empty array of users and channels and not include the additional objects.
